# tetris
The objective of Tetris is simple: players must arrange falling Tetromino shapes that descend from the top of the game screen to form complete horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears from the screen, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of Tetrominos reaches the top of the screen, and there's no more space to place the falling pieces.

The seven different Tetromino shapes include the following:

1. I-Shape (a straight line made of four squares)
2. T-Shape (a T-shaped piece made of four squares)
3. L-Shape (an L-shaped piece made of four squares)
4. J-Shape (a mirrored L-shaped piece made of four squares)
5. S-Shape (a zigzag piece made of four squares)
6. Z-Shape (a mirrored S-shaped piece made of four squares)
7. Square-Shape (a square made of four squares)
Creating a simple version of Tetris using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS involves designing the game's interface, handling game mechanics, and managing user interactions. Here's a brief overview of how you can implement it
